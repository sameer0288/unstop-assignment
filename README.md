This application is a seat booking application. There are 80 seats in total, with 7 seats in a row and 3 in the last row. Users can book at most 7 seats at a time. Initially, if the required number of seats is available in a row then it should book in the same row else it should book the seats with the least difference between the first and the last seat of the required number of seats. Then logic behind how seats are booked is handled from the backend and the display of seats and the user input for booking is handled by the frontend.

### NOTE
Once application is open please wait till 30 sec to 1 min until it loads or please refresh the webpage for 5-6 times.
